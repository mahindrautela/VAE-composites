# VAE based deep generation of composite materials

### This code is a part of the work presented in the paper:

### **Paper: Towards deep generation of guided wave representations for composite materials**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Basic Details:

#### - The dataset for the paper for the code is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7301863 

#### - The code is made on Python programming language using Tensorflow 2.x

#### - The instruction to use the dataset is described in the 'DatasetInformationDocument.pdf'

#### - For inverse material property estimator: load python model from https://github.com/mahindrautela/MatChar_dualCNN and read paper: https://doi.org/10.1080/15376494.2021.1982090
